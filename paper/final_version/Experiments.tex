We have three main experimental goals:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove it is possible to learn a useful image embedding function from publicly available and fuzzily labeled data
	\item Investigate, and quantify if possible, the effects of data fuzziness on model learning rates and generalizability
	\item Investigate how the presence of certain invariants in our data affects model generalizability
\end{enumerate}
